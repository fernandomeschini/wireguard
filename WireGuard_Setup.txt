Install WireGuard via whatever package manager you use.  For me, I use apt.

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:wireguard/wireguard
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install wireguard

MacOS
$ brew install wireguard-tools

Generate key your key pairs.  The key pairs are just that, key pairs.  They can be
generated on any device, as long as you keep the private key on the source and 
place the public on the destination.  

$ wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
example privatekey - mNb7OIIXTdgW4khM7OFlzJ+UPs7lmcWHV7xjPgakMkQ=
example publickey - 0qRWfQ2ihXSgzUbmHXQ70xOxDd7sZlgjqGSPA9PFuHg=

One can also generate a preshared key to add an additional layer of symmetric-key cryptography to be mixed into the already existing public-key cryptography, for post-quantum resistance.

# wg genpsk > preshared

Take the above private key, and place it in the server.  And conversely, put the 
public key on the peer.  Generate a second key pair, and do the opposite, put the
public on the server and the private on the peer.  Put the preshared key in the client config if you choose to use it.

On the server, create a conf file - /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf (These are examples,
so use whatever IP ranges and CIDR blocks that will work for your network.

Instead of having to modify the file for every client you want to add to the 
server you could also use the wg tool instead:

# add peer
wg set wg0 peer <client_pubkey> allowed-ips 10.0.0.x/32

# verify connection
wg

# save to config
wg-quick save wg0
